<h3 align="left">About project:</h3>
<p align="left">This project is a modal window with a user registration/authorization form. The project is an adaptive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop. According to the design, the form is divided into two visual parts. When creating this form I used flexbox to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. A specific feature of the layout was the background in the form of a triangle, which I made using the property 'border'. The rest of the elements were standard. The form contains two mandatory fields that contain validation.
